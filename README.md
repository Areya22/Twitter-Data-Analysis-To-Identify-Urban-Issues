# Twitter-Data-Analysis-to-Identify-Urban-Issues

## Problem Statement :
  In our project, we used data from Twitter- social media platform- to find issues that people deal with in day-to-day life. As this generates a huge amount of data, we have restricted our project to only Urban Problems. This includes things as simple as potholes and uncleared garbage dumps to something that can cause huge disastrous consequences like weak bridges and human trafficking. These are problems that disrupt a person’s day-to-day life if not dealt with and so we plan to ensure that the problems are heard and are addressed.
  
  We chose Twitter for two main reasons. One, it uses text as the most common format of posts and two, Twitter is already the most commonly used platform for people to complain or share the problems they’re facing. This makes it a good source for us to collect data and analyze it to find data relevant to urban issues and people do not have tolearn how to use a new interface.
  
## Objective :
The objective of this project is to use tweets to find problems citizens in urban areas are
facing on a daily basis. This is to help identify issues based on their type and bring it to
the notice of the concerned authorities as well as keep the public informed of the
frequency of the issues every fortnight.

This can be summarised in 3 points:
* Identifying issues among thousands of tweets.
* Segregate and publicise the problems based on their type.
* Update the public about the frequency of these problems.

This is a completely volunteer-at-will-based project where a person brings the problems
to notice by their own choice.

## Steps :

### Data Scraping and Manual Labelling

#### Categories
After gathering tweets from Mumbai region, we concluded that we can majorly categorise them into these 17 sections:
1. Trains
1. Traffic
1. Potholes
1. Transport
1. Illegal Parking and Hawkers
1. Illegal Banners
1. Noise

1. High Electricity Bills
1. Drainage and Water Supply Issues
1. Missing Person
1. Electricity Related
1. Gas Related
