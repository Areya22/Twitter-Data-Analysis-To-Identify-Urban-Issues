# Twitter-Data-Analysis-to-Identify-Urban-Issues

## Problem Statement
  In our project, we used data from Twitter- social media platform- to find issues that people deal with in day-to-day life. As this generates a huge amount of data, we have restricted our project to only Urban Problems. This includes things as simple as potholes and uncleared garbage dumps to something that can cause huge disastrous consequences like weak bridges and human trafficking. These are problems that disrupt a person’s day-to-day life if not dealt with and so we plan to ensure that the problems are heard and are addressed.
  
  We chose Twitter for two main reasons. One, it uses text as the most common format of posts and two, Twitter is already the most commonly used platform for people to complain or share the problems they’re facing. This makes it a good source for us to collect data and analyze it to find data relevant to urban issues and people do not have tolearn how to use a new interface.
